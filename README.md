## One-line summary
Normalizes trader inventories for Hideout Furniture and its expansions, with options for reducing how many furniture items are sold. Designed for GAMMA 0.9.3+

## Description

Bothered by the fact that only four vendors in the entire zone sells fridges? Me too. By default, in Hideout Furnitures Expansions, its items were only added to these vendors:
- Barkeep (can't level up, so he can never sell fridges, stoves etc.)
- Sakharov
- Sidorovich
- Freedom vendors
- Bandit vendors

This mod aims to normalize furnitures sold by vendors, while also allowing players to declutter trader inventories by only adding _some_ furnitures to the trader lists (primarily the ones that players can actually interact with and use). Decorative furnitures are crafting-only, or only available from bartenders (FOMOD install option).

### What does this mod do?

It uses the trade injection system from Hideout Furnitures to add Hideout Furnitures *Expanded* items to all vendors. It also blanks the trader DLTXes that comes with Hideout Furnitures Expanded to avoid duplicates.

As of version 2, the "Appliances-only" version of this mod removes all decorative furnitures from traders. It adds missing crafting recipes for decorative furniture, and also moves these crafting recipes to its own category in the crafting menu.

### Installation
- Download the file from Releases. Save it somewhere.
- In Mod Organizer 2, go to `File -> Install Mod...` or press `Ctrl + M` or click the "install mod" icon
- Select the file you just downloaded. Follow the instructions in the FOMOD installer.
  - Choose *either* the Full or Appliances-only version
  - You can choose if you want to enable "Extra fasteners for sale"
- The mod will be at the end of the modlist. Enable it.

If you change your mind, in MO2, right click "Everyone Sells Fridges" and "Reinstall mod...", pick the option you want, then choose "Replace".

This mod MUST overwrite Hideout Furnitures Expanded and Even More Hideout Furnitures to work. This mod is safe to install or uninstall mid-playthrough, though you will need to wait for a trader restock for the changes to take place.

I consider this mod generally complete and am unlikely to significantly update it in the future.
